A city isolated by the collapse of interdimensional portals, Hollowreach is a nexus of clashing ideologies and desperate survival. Explore its factions, key figures, and morally charged quests below.

## Factions

### The Loomkeepers  
**Description**:  
A collective of artisans (humans, dwarves, orcs) who preserve history through magical tapestries. Their works double as maps, records, and subtle spellcraft.  
**Motivation**: Decode the portal collapse via ancient patterns to restore connections or prevent past mistakes.  
**Influence**: Trade tapestries for supplies; their secrecy sparks distrust.  

#### Key Locations  
- **The Threadhall**: A multi-tiered workshop draped with vibrant tapestries. Hidden chambers store "living weaves" that record history in real time.  
- **Ashen Archive**: A fog-bound ruin holding lost portal sequences (quest location).  

#### Key Figures  
- **Vrenna Stoneweave**: Dwarf matriarch (80s), wise but wary of tampering with portals.  
- **Korzog**: Rebellious orc apprentice, seeks to weaponize tapestries against the fog.

### The Driftkin  
**Description**:  
Nomadic scavengers (elves, humans, half-orcs) dwelling in fog-resistant "driftbarges." Physically altered by the fog, they’re viewed as reckless outcasts.  
**Motivation**: Master the fog to evolve or find a mythical safe path through chaos.  
**Influence**: Supply rare materials but attract monsters to the city.  

#### Key Locations  
- **Driftmoor**: A fog-choked dockyard cluttered with salvaged tech and glowing portal shards.  
- **Vortex Reach**: A gravity-warping fog maelstrom (quest location).  

#### Key Figures  
- **Sylvara Tidewalker**: Charismatic elf pilot (120s), addicted to fog energy.  
- **Joren Halfhand**: Paranoid human mechanic with a magical prosthetic arm.  

---

### The Pulsefinders  
**Description**:  
A radical sect (gnomes, humans, elves) who worship the fog as a sentient god. Use psychedelic fog-plants and implants to commune with it, risking madness.  
**Motivation**: Merge with the fog’s consciousness to transcend mortality.  
**Influence**: Offer healing and visions but cause violent outbursts.  

#### Key Locations  
- **Verdant Hollow**: A temple overrun with glowing vines and pulsing fog-tech.  
- **Shrine of Whispers**: A fog-soaked neural cave network (quest location).  

#### Key Figures  
- **Eryndor Vinesoul**: Gnome prophet, fanatically believes the Amulet is divine.  
- **Mira Solace**: Doubtful acolyte, secretly seeks to undermine the cult.
