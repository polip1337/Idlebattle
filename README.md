## Factions

### The Loomkeepers
**Description**:  
A collective of artisans (humans, dwarves, orcs) who preserve history through magical  
tapestries that serve as maps, records, and spellcraft.  
**Motivation**: Decode the portal collapse via ancient patterns to restore connections  
or prevent past mistakes.  
**Influence**: Trade tapestries for supplies; their secrecy sparks distrust.

#### Key Locations
- **The Threadhall**: A multi-tiered workshop draped with vibrant tapestries. Hidden  
  chambers store "living weaves" that record history in real time.
- **Ashen Archive**: A fog-bound ruin holding lost portal sequences (quest location).
- **Spindle Vault**: A subterranean library of forbidden weaves, guarded by sentient  
  threads that test intruders’ motives.

#### Key Figures
- **Vrenna Stoneweave**: Dwarf matriarch (80s), wise but wary of tampering with portals.
- **Korzog**: Rebellious orc apprentice, seeks to weaponize tapestries against the fog.

### The Driftkin
**Description**:  
Nomadic scavengers (elves, humans, half-orcs) dwelling in fog-resistant "driftbarges."  
Physically altered by the fog, they’re viewed as reckless outcasts.  
**Motivation**: Master the fog to evolve or find a mythical safe path through chaos.  
**Influence**: Supply rare materials but attract monsters to the city.

#### Key Locations
- **Driftmoor**: A fog-choked dockyard cluttered with salvaged tech and glowing portal  
  shards.
- **Vortex Reach**: A gravity-warping fog maelstrom (quest location).
- **Shardwreck Bay**: A jagged coastal graveyard of crashed barges, rumored to hide a  
  portal anchor.

#### Key Figures
- **Sylvara Tidewalker**: Charismatic elf pilot (120s), addicted to fog energy.
- **Joren Halfhand**: Paranoid human mechanic with a magical prosthetic arm.

### The Pulsefinders
**Description**:  
A radical sect (gnomes, humans, elves) who worship the fog as a sentient god. Use  
psychedelic fog-plants and implants to commune with it, risking madness.  
**Motivation**: Merge with the fog’s consciousness to transcend mortality.  
**Influence**: Offer healing and visions but cause violent outbursts.

#### Key Locations
- **Verdant Hollow**: A temple overrun with glowing vines and pulsing fog-tech.
- **Shrine of Whispers**: A fog-soaked neural cave network (quest location).
- **Mistspire**: A towering, fog-infused obelisk emitting hypnotic pulses, used for  
  rituals.

#### Key Figures
- **Eryndor Vinesoul**: Gnome prophet, fanatically believes the fog is divine.
- **Mira Solace**: Doubtful acolyte, secretly seeks to undermine the cult.

### The Emberclad
**Description**:  
The oldest faction, hailing from the Old Empire, once mighty but now diminished. This  
fire-worshipping order (humans, dwarves, gnomes) uses pyromancy to combat the fog,  
believing it an abomination.  
**Motivation**: Burn away the fog to restore the Old Empire’s glory, viewing it as a  
curse from failed portal experiments.  
**Influence**: Their pyromantic rituals purify small areas but risk city-wide fires,  
making them pariahs.

#### Key Locations
- **Cinderhold**: A crumbling fortress-temple lined with eternal braziers, barely  
  maintained.
- **Scorchveil Pit**: A volcanic crater where they perform fog-burning rituals (quest  
  location).

#### Key Figures
- **Drenvar Ironflame**: Aging human pyromancer (60s), clings to fading traditions but  
  commands respect.
- **Lyra Emberkin**: Young gnome radical, pushes for aggressive fire-cleansing, even at  
  the cost of Hollowreach.

## Unaligned Locations
**The Orphan’s Hollow**:  
A dilapidated orphanage on the city’s edge, where Taryn grew up. Its crumbling walls  
hide secret stashes from past residents.  
**Rustmarket**:  
A neutral bazaar where all factions trade. Thieves and spies lurk among the stalls.  
**Ironspire Bridge**:  
A fog-shrouded bridge connecting Hollowreach’s districts, rumored to house a dormant  
portal frame.  
**Fogscar Vault**:  
A buried Old Empire ruin beneath Rustmarket, filled with glowing runes and guarded by  
ancient constructs.

## Key Unaligned Characters

Taryn’s childhood friend from the orphanage, now a charming thief in Rustmarket. Offers  
shady jobs but is loyal if paid. Skilled with daggers and traps.

past and offers cryptic advice.

A gnome scavenger, once Taryn’s orphanage bunkmate, now obsessed with building  
fog-powered gadgets. Neutral but unreliable, often selling secrets to any faction.  
**Zynia Velt**:  
A human ex-Pulsefinder who fled the cult after a failed implant. Now a cynical  
mercenary in Rustmarket, skilled with a crossbow, and distrusts Taryn due to past  
orphanage pranks.  
**Tharok One-Eye**:  
An orc storyteller who roams Ironspire Bridge, trading tales for food. A former  
acquaintance of Taryn’s, he’s wise but manipulative, hiding knowledge of the portal  
collapse.

## Side Quests

### 0. Intro Quest: The Fogscar Heist (Unaligned, Combat Tutorial)
**Objective**:  
Infiltrate the Fogscar Vault with Renn to steal a legendary artifact, the Mistwalker  
Amulet.  
**Description**:  
Taryn, fresh from the orphanage, reunites with Renn in Rustmarket, who’s learned of the  
Mistwalker Amulet through his black-market contacts—a relic said to let its wearer  
traverse the fog unharmed. The duo sneaks into the Fogscar Vault, a rune-lit Old Empire  
ruin beneath Rustmarket. Renn teaches Taryn basic combat mechanics (dodging, striking,  
and using environmental traps like collapsing pillars) during an easy fight against  
fog-touched scavengers hopped up on Pulsefinder plants. After defeating the scavengers,  
Taryn secretly pockets the Amulet while Renn is distracted. Grabbing the artifact  
awakens a towering Old Empire guardian construct—impossible to defeat—teaching Taryn  
that fleeing is a valid strategy. As they escape, the guardian’s rampage collapses the  
vault, burying its secrets. Renn remains unaware Taryn kept the Amulet, setting up  
future tension.  
**Complications**:  
The scavengers are erratic from fog-plants, making their attacks unpredictable; Zynia  
Velt shadows the duo, potentially reporting to factions
