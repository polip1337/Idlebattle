    "description": "A dilapidated three-story building on the city's edge, its once-white walls now stained with age and fog residue. The orphanage stands as a testament to better times, with boarded-up windows and a creaking sign that reads 'Orphan's Hollow' in faded letters. Inside, the building is surprisingly well-maintained despite its exterior, with clean floors and walls decorated with children's drawings. Secret stashes from past residents are rumored to be hidden within its crumbling walls.",
