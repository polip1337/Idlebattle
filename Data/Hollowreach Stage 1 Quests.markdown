## Hollowreach Staged Quests: Stage 1 - The Mistwalker’s Awakening

**Stage Description**: Taryn, wielding the Mistwalker Amulet from the "Fogscar Heist," seeks to unlock its fog-repelling power, unique to them, amid Hollowreach’s food crisis. They must prove the amulet’s worth to factions (Loomkeepers, Driftkin, Emberclad) through a main quest and side quests, shaping alliances and Stage 2 support.

### Main Quest: The Mistwalker’s Secret

- **Objective**: Uncover the Mistwalker Amulet’s secrets and choose a faction to share them with.
- **Description**: Taryn and Renn Quickfingers explore the Ashen Archive to activate the amulet’s fog-repelling power, tied to Old Empire portals. They face rune-etched sentries and fog traps, while Korzog, a rogue Loomkeeper, tries to steal the amulet. Solving rune puzzles reveals the amulet’s potential, but Taryn must decide whether to align with a faction, requiring side quest proof.
- **Complications**: Korzog’s ambush and fog traps challenge navigation and combat.
- **Node Progression**:
  1. **Dialogue (Rustmarket)**: Meet Renn to discuss the amulet’s origins.

     - *Outcome*: Defeat grants access to Rune Chamber.
     - *Unlocks*: Travel node to Rune Chamber.
  5. **Visit a travel node (Rune Chamber)**: Solve rune puzzles to activate the amulet.

     - *Outcome*: 
       - *Share with Loomkeepers*: Gain Loomkeeper Portal Map, +10 Loomkeeper reputation, -5 Driftkin/Emberclad.
       - *Share with Driftkin*: Gain Driftkin Fog Compass, +10 Driftkin reputation, -5 Loomkeepers/Emberclad.
       - *Share with Emberclad*: Gain Emberclad Flame Ward, +10 Emberclad reputation, -5 Loomkeepers/Driftkin.
     - *Unlocks*: Stage 2 quests.
- **Affects**: The chosen faction provides a tool for Stage 2: Loomkeeper Portal Map boosts scouting, Driftkin Fog Compass aids navigation, or Emberclad Flame Ward eases combat. This locks in a primary ally, affecting side quest availability and faction responses in later stages, particularly Stage 2’s caravan scout mission.

- **Faction**: Emberclad
- **Objective**: Assist Lyra Emberkin’s fog-burning ritual with the amulet.
